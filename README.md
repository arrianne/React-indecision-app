# React-indecision-app

This is my first ever React application developed following the Udemy course 'The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)'

This simple indecision app has provided me with the fundamentals of React while seeing exactly what it takes to get a React app up and running.

It has also been a great introduction to Babel, a JavaScript compiler that I have never used before.
