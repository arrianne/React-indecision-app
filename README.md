# React-indecision-app

This is my first ever React application developed following the Udemy course 'The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)'

This simple indecision app has provided me with the fundamentals of React while seeing exactly what it takes to get a React app up and running.

To start with it has been a great introduction to Babel, a JavaScript compiler that I have never used before.

I learnt how to use JavaScript expressions to create dynamic JSX eg.

```
var app = {
  title: 'Indecision app',
  subtitle: 'This is a subtitle'
};

var template = (
  <div>
    <h1>{app.title}</h1>
    <p>{app.subtitle}</p>
  </div>
);
```
